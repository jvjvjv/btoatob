# B(to)A(to)B
A quick JavaScript mini-app to help me with stuff at work.

## Description

I threw this together in abbout 20 minutes. On the left side you can enter JSON and it will be converted to a base64 string. On the right, the exact opposite: Pasting a base64 string will translate it to JSON.

I needed this for work because we would have to use two different websites to help transform JSON to base64 and back. And they didn't even validate the JSON. 

## Installation

This page utilizes AngularJS and Bootstrap from CDN.

Simply clone the repository
